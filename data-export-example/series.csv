1,trafalgar,The True Story of Trafalgar,A famous square. A legendary battle. The untold lives behind the history.,1,2026-01-10 03:27:36,2026-01-10 03:27:36,,Volume One,"Today we can travel to London and experience the many historical sites, including beautiful Trafalgar Square, in the area known as Charing Cross. We think that the statue of Admiral Nelson that stands watch on top of the tall column represents the Battle of Trafalgar and the naming of the square, but it is only a small part of a greater story that involves the lives of many people. The True Story of Trafalgar reveals the names and details of many persons recorded in history and many others who lived their lives in relative anonymity, but perhaps enjoying life every bit as much as their famous counterparts. Welcome to volume one taking place primarily in London and Garristown, Ireland, where George and Riley show us that life and love can be very complicated.","[""Historical Fiction""]","[""historical fiction"",""london"",""ireland"",""trafalgar"",""character-driven""]",/images/og/books/true-story-of-trafalgar.jpg,/images/books/trafalgar/trafalgar1.png,"[{""type"":""kindle"",""label"":""Kindle"",""url"":""https://www.amazon.com/True-Story-Trafalgar-One-ebook/dp/B0FK1XDKD5""},{""type"":""audiobook"",""label"":""Audiobook"",""url"":""https://www.amazon.com/True-Story-Trafalgar-One/dp/B0FMKHFDB6""}]"
